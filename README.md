If it's difficult to use a tool, the tool is at fault. Not the user. I am building tools that users can pick up and use intuitively, no 40 page manuals here - only 4000 lines of  procedural code ðŸ™ƒ Don't frown at my code, anything I write today will be be re-written in 18 months. So, let's just be nice to each other, because, we will be around for lot longer than that ðŸ¤ž
